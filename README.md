# README

This repository provides code to reproduce the results of the following paper:


> Ignatiadis, N., Saha, S., Sun D. L., & Muralidharan, O. (2019).  **Empirical Bayes mean estimation with nonparametric errors via order statistic regression.** [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05970)


The main method has been implemented in Julia and is available as the [Aurora.jl](https://github.com/nignatiadis/Aurora.jl) Julia package.
The repository is currently being updated to include the different methods and simulations in a R package that wraps the Julia package.

It may be installed as follows:

```r
devtools::install_github("nignatiadis/AuroraPaper", subdir="AuroraR")
```
